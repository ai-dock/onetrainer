# OneTrainer Docker Image

Run [OneTrainer](https://github.com/Nerogar/OneTrainer) in a docker container locally or in the cloud.

These container images are tested extensively at [Vast.ai](https://link.ai-dock.org/template-vast-onetrainer-jupyter) & [Runpod.io](https://link.ai-dock.org/template-runpod-onetrainer-jupyter) but compatibility with other GPU cloud services is expected.

>[!NOTE]
>These images do not bundle models or third-party configurations. You should use a [provisioning script](#provisioning-script) to automatically configure your container. You can find examples in `config/provisioning`.

## Quick Start

Simply declare your [environment variables](#environment-variables) and launch a container with `docker compose` or choose a pre-configured [cloud template](#pre-configured-templates).

## About OneTrainer

OneTrainer is described as a one-stop solution for all your stable diffusion training needs. It's a GUI based tool with an alternative command line interface.

Some features:

**Supported models**: Stable Diffusion 1.5, 2.0, 2.1, SDXL, WÃ¼rstchen-v2, Stable Cascade, PixArt-Alpha and inpainting models

**Model formats**: diffusers and ckpt models

**Training methods**: Full fine-tuning, LoRA, embeddings

**Masked Training**: Let the training focus on just certain parts of the samples.

**Automatic backups**: Fully back up your training progress regularly during training. This includes all information to seamlessly continue training.

**Image augmentation**: Apply random transforms such as rotation, brightness, contrast or saturation to each image sample to quickly create a more diverse dataset.

**Tensorboard**: A simple tensorboard integration to track the training progress.

**Multiple prompts per image**: Train the model on multiple different prompts per image sample.

**Noise Scheduler Rescaling:** From the paper Common Diffusion Noise Schedules and Sample Steps are Flawed

**EMA**: Train you own EMA model. Optionally keep EMA weights in CPU memory to reduce VRAM usage.

**Aspect Ratio Bucketing**: Automatically train on multiple aspect ratios at a time. Just select the target resolutions, buckets are created automatically.

**Multi Resolution Training**: Train multiple resolutions at the same time.

**Dataset Tooling**: Automatically caption your dataset using BLIP, BLIP2 and WD-1.4, or create masks for masked training using ClipSeg or Rembg.

**Model Tooling**: Convert between different model formats from a simple UI.

**Sampling UI**: Sample the model during training without switching to a different application.

**AlignProp**: A Reinforcement Learning method for diffusion networks from the paper


## Pre-built Images

Docker images are built automatically through a GitHub Actions workflow and hosted at the GitHub Container Registry.

An incremental build process is used to avoid needing a huge cache - The following images are used to provide functionality:

- [nvidia/cuda](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker) / [ubuntu](https://github.com/docker-library/docs/tree/master/ubuntu) &#8628;
- [ai-dock/base-image](https://github.com/ai-dock/base-image) &#8628;
- [ai-dock/python](https://github.com/ai-dock/python) &#8628;
- [ai-dock/pytorch](https://github.com/ai-dock/pytorch) / [ai-dock/jupyter-pytorch](https://github.com/ai-dock/jupyter-pytorch) &#8628;
- [ai-dock/linux-desktop:jupyter-pytorch](https://github.com/ai-dock/linux-desktop) &#8628;
- ai-dock/onetrainer

#### Version Tags

The `:latest` tag points to `:latest-cuda`

Tags follow these patterns:

##### _CUDA_
- `:pytorch-[pytorch-version]-py[python-version]-cuda-[x.x.x]-base-[ubuntu-version]`

- `:latest-cuda` &rarr; `:pytorch-2.1.2-py3.10-cuda-11.8.0-base-22.04`

- `:latest-cuda-jupyter` &rarr; `:jupyter-pytorch-2.1.2-py3.10-cuda-11.8.0-base-22.04`

Browse [here](https://github.com/ai-dock/onetrainer/pkgs/container/onetrainer) for an image suitable for your target environment.

You can also [build from source](#building-images) by editing `.env` and running `docker compose build`.

Supported Python versions: `3.10`

Supported Pytorch versions: `2.1.2`, `2.2.0`

Supported Platforms: `NVIDIA CUDA`


## Building Images

You can self-build from source by editing `docker-compose.yaml` or `.env` and running `docker compose build`. 

It is a good idea to leave the main source tree alone and copy any extra files you would like in the container into `build/COPY_ROOT_EXTRA/...`. The structure within this directory will be overlayed on `/` near the end of the build process.

After copying has been completed, the script `build/COPY_ROOT_EXTRA/opt/ai-dock/bin/build/layer1/init.sh` will be executed. A template for this file capable of downloading models and nodes is provided for convenience.

Any directories and files that you add into `opt/storage` will be made available in the running container at `$WORKSPACE/storage` through symbolic links.  

This directory is monitored by `inotifywait`. Any items appearing here will be automatically symlinked to the application directories as defined in `/opt/ai-dock/storage_monitor/etc/mappings.sh`.

## Run Locally

A 'feature-complete' `docker-compose.yaml` file is included for your convenience. All features of the image are included - Simply edit the environment variables in `.env`, save and then type `docker compose up`.

If you prefer to use the standard `docker run` syntax, the command to pass is `init.sh`.

## Run in the Cloud

This image should be compatible with any GPU cloud platform. You simply need to pass environment variables at runtime. 

>[!NOTE]  
>Please raise an issue on this repository if your provider cannot run the image.

__Container Cloud__

Container providers don't give you access to the docker host but are quick and easy to set up. They are often inexpensive when compared to a full VM or bare metal solution.

All images built for ai-dock are tested for compatibility with both [vast.ai](https://link.ai-dock.org/template-vast-onetrainer) and [runpod.io](https://link.ai-dock.org/template-runpod-onetrainer).

See a list of pre-configured templates [here](#pre-configured-templates)

>[!WARNING]  
>Container cloud providers may offer both 'community' and 'secure' versions of their cloud. If your usecase involves storing sensitive information (eg. API keys, auth tokens) then you should always choose the secure option.

__VM Cloud__

Running docker images on a virtual machine/bare metal server is much like running locally.

You'll need to:
- Configure your server
- Set up docker
- Clone this repository
- Edit `.env`and `docker-compose.yml`
- Run `docker compose up`

Find a list of compatible VM providers [here](#compatible-vm-providers).

### Connecting to Your Instance

All services listen for connections at [`0.0.0.0`](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/0.0.0.0). This gives you some flexibility in how you interact with your instance:

_**Expose the Ports**_

This is fine if you are working locally but can be **dangerous for remote connections** where data is passed in plaintext between your machine and the container over http.

_**SSH Tunnel**_

You will only need to expose port `22` (SSH) which can then be used with port forwarding to allow **secure** connections to your services.

If you are unfamiliar with port forwarding then you should read the guides [here](https://link.ai-dock.org/guide-ssh-tunnel-do-a) and [here](https://link.ai-dock.org/guide-ssh-tunnel-do-b).

_**Cloudflare Tunnel**_

You can use the included `cloudflared` service to make secure connections without having to expose any ports to the public internet. See more below.

## Environment Variables

| Variable                 | Description |
| ------------------------ | ----------- |
| `CF_TUNNEL_TOKEN`        | Cloudflare zero trust tunnel token - See [documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/). |
| `CF_QUICK_TUNNELS`       | Create ephemeral Cloudflare tunnels for web services (default `true`) |
| `ONETRAINER_BRANCH`      | OneTrainer branch/commit hash. Defaults to `master` |
| `ONETRAINER_FLAGS`       | Startup flags. eg. `--generic-option1 --generic-option2` |
| `DIRECT_ADDRESS`         | IP/hostname for service portal direct links (default `localhost`) |
| `DIRECT_ADDRESS_GET_WAN` | Use the internet facing interface for direct links (default `false`) |
| `GPU_COUNT`              | Limit the number of available GPUs |
| `PROVISIONING_SCRIPT`    | URL of a remote script to execute on init. See [note](#provisioning-script). |
| `RCLONE_*`               | Rclone configuration - See [rclone documentation](https://rclone.org/docs/#config-file) |
| `SKIP_ACL`               | Set `true` to skip modifying workspace ACL |
| `SSH_PORT_LOCAL`         | Set a non-standard port for SSH (default `22`) |
| `USER_NAME`              | System account username (default `user`)|
| `USER_PASSWORD`          | System account username (default `password`)|
| `WEB_ENABLE_AUTH`        | Enable password protection for web services (default `true`) |
| `WEB_USER`               | Username for web services (default `user`) |
| `WEB_PASSWORD`           | Password for web services (default `auto generated`) |
| `WORKSPACE`              | A volume path. Defaults to `/workspace/` |
| `WORKSPACE_SYNC`         | Move mamba environments and services to workspace if mounted (default `false`) |

Environment variables can be specified by using any of the standard methods (`docker-compose.yaml`, `docker run -e...`). Additionally, environment variables can also be passed as parameters of `init.sh`.

Passing environment variables to init.sh is usually unnecessary, but is useful for some cloud environments where the full `docker run` command cannot be specified.

Example usage: `docker run -e STANDARD_VAR1="this value" -e STANDARD_VAR2="that value" init.sh EXTRA_VAR="other value"`

## Security

All ai-dock containers are interactive and will not drop root privileges. You should ensure that your docker daemon runs as an unprivileged user.

### System

A system user will be created at startup. The UID will be either 1000 or will match the UID of the `$WORKSPACE` bind mount.

The user will share the root user's ssh public key.

Some processes may start in the user context for convenience only.

### Web Services

By default, all exposed web services are protected by a single login form at `:1111/login`.

The default username is `user` and the password is auto generated unless you have passed a value in the environment variable `WEB_PASSWORD`. To find the auto-generated password and related tokens you should type `env | grep WEB_` from inside the container.

You can set your credentials by passing environment variables as shown above.

If you are running the image locally on a trusted network, you may disable authentication by setting the environment variable `WEB_ENABLE_AUTH=false`.

If you need to connect programmatically to the web services you can authenticate using either `Bearer $WEB_TOKEN` or `Basic $WEB_PASSWORD_B64`.

The security measures included aim to be as secure as basic authentication, i.e. not secure without HTTPS.  Please use the provided cloudflare connections wherever possible.

>[!NOTE]  
>You can use `set-web-credentials.sh <username> <password>` to change the username and password in a running container.

## Provisioning script

It can be useful to perform certain actions when starting a container, such as creating directories and downloading files.

You can use the environment variable `PROVISIONING_SCRIPT` to specify the URL of a script you'd like to run.

The URL must point to a plain text file - GitHub Gists/Pastebin (raw) are suitable options.

If you are running locally you may instead opt to mount a script at `/opt/ai-dock/bin/provisioning.sh`.

>[!NOTE]  
>If configured, `sshd`, `caddy`, `cloudflared`, `serviceportal`, `storagemonitor` & `logtail` will be launched before provisioning; Any other processes will launch after.

>[!WARNING]  
>Only use scripts that you trust and which cannot be changed without your consent.

## Software Management

A small software collection is installed by apt-get to provide basic utility.

All other software is installed into its own environment by `micromamba`, which is a drop-in replacement for conda/mamba. Read more about it [here](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/micromamba.html).

Micromamba environments are particularly useful where several software packages are required but their dependencies conflict. 

### Installed Micromamba Environments

| Environment    | Packages |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `base`         | micromamba's base environment |
| `onetrainer`   | OneTrainer and dependencies |
| `python_[ver]` | `python` |

If you are extending this image or running an interactive session where additional software is required, you should almost certainly create a new environment first. See below for guidance.

### Useful Micromamba Commands

| Command                              | Function |
| -------------------------------------| --------------------- |
| `micromamba env list`                | List available environments |
| `micromamba activate [name]`         | Activate the named environment |
| `micromamba deactivate`              | Close the active environment |
| `micromamba run -n [name] [command]` | Run a command in the named environment without activating |

All ai-dock images create micromamba environments using the `--always-softlink` flag which can save disk space where multiple environments are available.

To create an additional micromamba environment, eg for python, you can use the following:

`micromamba --always-softlink create -y -c conda-forge -c defaults -n [name] python=3.10`

## Volumes

Data inside docker containers is ephemeral - You'll lose all of it when the container is destroyed.

You may opt to mount a data volume at `/workspace` - This is a directory that ai-dock images will look for to make downloaded data available outside of the container for persistence. 

When the runtime scripts detect a mounted workspace, the `OneTrainer` directory will be moved there from its original location in `/opt`. If the workspace is not mounted then a symlink will be created for convenience.

You can define an alternative path for the workspace directory by passing the environment variable `WORKSPACE=/my/alternative/path/` and mounting your volume there. This feature will generally assist where cloud providers enforce their own mountpoint location for persistent storage.

The provided docker-compose.yaml will mount the local directory `./workspace` at `/workspace`.

## Running Services

This image will spawn multiple processes upon starting a container because some of our remote environments do not support more than one container per instance.

All processes are managed by [supervisord](https://supervisord.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and will restart upon failure until you either manually stop them or terminate the container.

>[!NOTE]  
>*Some of the included services would not normally be found **inside** of a container. They are, however, necessary here as some cloud providers give no access to the host; Containers are deployed as if they were a virtual machine.*

### Selkies-gstreamer

This provides the RTC interface for accessing the desktop through a web browser.

The service will bind to port `6100`.

See the [project page](https://github.com/selkies-project/selkies-gstreamer) for more information.

### Kasm VNC

This provides the VNC fallback interface for accessing the desktop through a web browser.

The service will bind to port `6200`.

See the [project page](https://kasmweb.com/kasmvnc) for more information.

### Kasm X Proxy

This service relays the desktop on display `:0` to the VNC on display `:1`

Learn about kasmxproxy [here](https://kasmweb.com/kasmvnc/docs/master/man/kasmxproxy.html).

### KDE Plasma

KDE plasma desktop environment.  Restarting this service will also restart the currently running X server.

### X Server

Either an Xorg server when running on NVIDIA hardware or Xvfb for VirtualGL rendering.

### Fcitx

Fcitx [ËfaÉªtÉªks] is an input method framework with extension support.

See the [project page](https://fcitx-im.org/) for more information.

### Pulseaudio

Provides audio support for the WebRTC interface.  Audio is not supported over VNC.

### Caddy

This is a simple webserver acting as a reverse proxy.

Caddy is used to enable basic authentication for all sensitive web services.

To make changes to the caddy configuration inside a runing container you should edit `/opt/caddy/share/base_config` followed by `supervisorctl restart caddy`.

### Service Portal

This is a simple list of links to the web services available inside the container.

The service will bind to port `1111`.

For each service, you will find a direct link and, if you have set `CF_QUICK_TUNNELS=true`, a link to the service via a fast and secure Cloudflare tunnel.

A simple web-based log viewer and process manager are included for convenience.

### Cloudflared

The Cloudflare tunnel daemon will start if you have provided a token with the `CF_TUNNEL_TOKEN` environment variable.

This service allows you to connect to your local services via https without exposing any ports.

You can also create a private network to enable remote connecions to the container at its local address (`172.x.x.x`) if your local machine is running a Cloudflare WARP client.

If you do not wish to provide a tunnel token, you could enable `CF_QUICK_TUNNELS` which will create a throwaway tunnel for your web services.

Full documentation for Cloudflare tunnels is [here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/).

>[!NOTE]  
>_Cloudflared is included so that secure networking is available in all cloud environments._

>[!WARNING]  
>You should only provide tunnel tokens in secure cloud environments.

### SSHD

A SSH server will be started if at least one valid public key is found inside the running container in the file `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys`

The server will bind to port `22` unless you specify variable `SSH_PORT`.

There are several ways to get your keys to the container.

- If using docker compose, you can paste your key in the local file `config/authorized_keys` before starting the container.
 
- You can pass the environment variable `SSH_PUBKEY` with your public key as the value.

- Cloud providers often have a built-in method to transfer your key into the container

If you choose not to provide a public key then the SSH server will not be started.

To make use of this service you should map port `22` to a port of your choice on the host operating system.

See [this guide](https://link.ai-dock.org/guide-sshd-do) by DigitalOcean for an excellent introduction to working with SSH servers.

>[!NOTE]  
>_SSHD is included because the end-user should be able to know the version prior to deloyment. Using a providers add-on, if available, does not guarantee this._

>[!WARNING]  
>You should only provide auth tokens in secure cloud environments.

### Jupyter

The jupyter server will launch a `lab` instance unless you specify `JUPYTER_MODE=notebook`.

Jupyter server will listen on port `8888` unless you have specified an alternative with the `JUPYTER_PORT` environment variable.

A python kernel will be installed coresponding with the python version of the image.

Jupyter's official documentation is available at https://jupyter.org/

### Logtail

This script follows and prints the log files for each of the above services to stdout. This allows you to follow the progress of all running services through docker's own logging system.

If you are logged into the container you can follow the logs by running `logtail.sh` in your shell.

### Storage Monitor

This service detects changes to files in `$WORKSPACE/storage` and creates symbolic links to the application directories defined in `/opt/ai-dock/storage_monitor/etc/mappings.sh`

## Open Ports

Some ports need to be exposed for the services to run or for certain features of the provided software to function

| Open Port             | Service / Description     |
| --------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `22`                  | SSH server                |
| `1111`                | Service portal web UI     |
| `3478`                | Coturn turn server        |
| `6100`                | Selkies WebRTC interface  |
| `6200`                | KASMVNC Interface
| `8188`                | Jupyter server
