## Notice:

I have chosen to apply a custom license to this software for the following reasons:

- **Uniqueness of Containers:** Common open-source licenses may not adequately address the nuances of software distributed within containers. My custom license ensures clarity regarding the separation of my code from bundled software, thereby respecting the rights of other authors.

- **Preservation of Source Code Integrity:** I am committed to maintaining the integrity of the source code while adhering to the spirit of open-source software. My custom license helps ensure transparency and accountability in my development practices.

- **Funding and Control of Distribution:** Some of the funding for this project comes from maintaining control of distribution. This funding model wouldn't be possible without limiting distribution in certain ways, ultimately supporting the project's mission.

- **Empowering Access:** Supported by controlled distribution, the mission of this project is to empower users with access to valuable tools and resources in the cloud, enabling them to utilize software that may otherwise require hardware resources beyond their reach.

I welcome sponsorship from commercial entities utilizing this software, although it is not mandatory. Your support helps sustain the ongoing development and improvement of this project.
